# Tidbyt + Revolution

[Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) app that shows the "Revolution" clock I originally built as a [watchface for the Pebble smartwatch](https://github.com/DouweM/PebbleRevolution) in 2013.

The design is based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](https://www.xataka.com/videojuegos/freebox-revolution-el-equipo-definitivo), which was designed by Philippe Starck.
It was originally envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the "Watch-face ideas" thread on the Pebble forums.

## Installation

This app is not available through Tidbyt's mobile app as it uses features that (for security reasons) are not supported in [community apps](https://tidbyt.dev/docs/publish/community-apps) that run on Tidbyt's official app server.

Instead, it needs to be run using [Pixbyt](https://pixbyt.dev), a self-hosted Tidbyt app server for advanced apps.

### 1. Set up Pixbyt

1. [Create your own Pixbyt repo](https://github.com/DouweM/pixbyt#1-create-your-own-pixbyt-repo)
2. [Configure your Tidbyt](https://github.com/DouweM/pixbyt#2-configure-your-tidbyt)

### 2. Install the app

1. Add this repo as a submodule under `apps`:

    ```bash
    git submodule add https://github.com/DouweM/tidbyt-revolution.git apps/revolution
    ```

1. Add an update schedule to `apps.yml` under `schedules:`:

    ```yaml
    schedules:
    # ...
    - name: revolution
      interval: '* * * * *' # Every minute
      job: revolution
    ```

## Usage

Build and launch your Pixbyt app server:

1. [Build the app server](https://github.com/DouweM/pixbyt#4-build-the-app-server)
1. [Launch the app server](https://github.com/DouweM/pixbyt#5-launch-the-app-server)
